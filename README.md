# A simple cashier app called Cash it Here

Cash it Here app is build with [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), HTML, CSS3, and Javascript. No other plugin attached to this app. This app using [materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) css framework to create material style UI.

## Single Page Style
This app implementing single page application style in admin dashboard so the adminController.js might be looks so messy. I'll do refactoring to my code to make it more readable to anyone.

## What I'm gonna do next?
- [ ] Completing the cashier page
- [ ] Refactoring my whole code (_this gonna be frustrating_)
- [ ] Do some variable name change to make it readable for any other person with other language
- [ ] Simplify my code

## Bugs?
I'm sure there's so many bugs. But I don't know that yet. If you found some please contact me.
